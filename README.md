This is Brandon's very first project, recreating the Google home page!
I will be applying basic HTML and CSS concepts.

Here are some tips I learned along the way:
- Google is your friend! This stuff also takes a while

Here are some things I reviewed or relearned:
- "div" is a way to group together elements at your own leisure
- An element is everything between the start of the tag to the end of the tag as in:
    <tag>content</tag>
